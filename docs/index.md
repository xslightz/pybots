### What is a python “bot”?

A python bot or well it does not matter which programing language you use a bot is a program created to Automate task or perform any task that takes you hours to accomplish. You can program a bot to do just about anything find files, run other programs send emails, texts post to reddit twitter just about anything computer related.

No shame in creating a bot to automate your task and cut time for another task you would need to do on a daily basis. Why do I like python bots? The language is clean easy to learn yet powerful sure there is so much more you can do than just bots but is fun so I’ll stick t fun for now.
